Basket trials have emerged as an efficient method for assessing a novel drug across multiple disease indications (or patient subgroups) simultaneously. This paper proposes a novel Bayesian adaptive design for evaluating and optimizing indication-specific doses in randomized multi-dose, multi-indication basket trials. To address potential heterogeneity between indications, the Bayesian model averaging approach is utilized to adaptively cluster patient indications. A Bayesian hierarchical dynamic linear model is developed to model indication-specific dose-response relationships within an indication cluster. By hybridizing these two modeling strategies, information is reliably integrated across multiple doses and indications, thereby increasing trial efficiency. Under the Bayesian inference framework, the indication-specific optimal dose can be identified based on a utility function that quantifies the trade-off between toxicity and efficacy, and the proof of concept for the treatment effect in each indication can also be established. The validity and advantages of the proposed model and design are exemplified through the reanalysis and redesign of the IMMU-132 trial.
